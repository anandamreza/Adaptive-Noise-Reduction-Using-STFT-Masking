# Adaptive Noise Reduction Using STFT Masking
This project applies noise reduction to speech audio using a Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT)–based masking algorithm. The method extracts a noise sample from the first few seconds of the recording, estimates its frequency distribution, and constructs a thresholded mask to suppress noise while preserving speech content.
